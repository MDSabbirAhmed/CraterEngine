pi-billion.txt was collected from MIT and as the name suggests, the file contains to the billionth decimal point of the number PI.

we dont need that much precision for any practical project as only to 16th point is enough for planetary level precision roughly speaking.
we are good to go with to 8th decimal value of pi.
